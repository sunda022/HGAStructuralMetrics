# Cirrus Studio Basic Revit Addin

Basic Revit addin boilerplate code used for Revit addin development.
The code builds a .NET Framework class library which can be loaded into Revit.
As frontend the application uses Windows Presentation Foundation framework with MVVM pattern.

## Build
1. Clone the solution from the main branch.
2. Build the solution with Configuration set to Debug. Built assemblies should be located in the `Assemblies.Debug` folder.
3. Copy the `CirrusAddin.addin` file to `C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\<REVIT_VERSION>` folder.
4. Open the `CirrusAddin.addin` file and change <Assembly> tag to point to the `CirrusAddin.dll` file located in the `Assemblies.Debug` folder.
5. Start coding your new addin! ðŸš€
